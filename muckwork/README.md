# TODO:

* foreign exchange rates

# Some day:

* ledger accounting for currency exchange

# THOUGHTS:

Should client charge be based on project or task?  I originally thought project, but maybe seeing individual charges is more appealing?  And what if they choose to not finish a project?  (I'm assuming we'll mark a project as finished if they don't want to continue with it.)
