# TODO:

## Client:

* sign up anew
* sign up using existing email + pass
* update all info
* locations & currencies
* mark new project as ready to be quoted
* create payment
* delete unstarted project


# THOUGHTS:

Should client charge be based on project or task?  I originally thought project, but maybe seeing individual charges is more appealing?  And what if they choose to not finish a project?  (I'm assuming we'll mark a project as finished if they don't want to continue with it.)
